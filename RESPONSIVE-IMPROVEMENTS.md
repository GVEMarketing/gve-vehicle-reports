# Dynamic Responsive Design Improvements

## What's New in `index-dynamic.html`

### 1. **Fixed PDF Download**
- Improved PDF generation using fetch API instead of iframe
- Better image handling with proper path resolution
- Multi-page PDF support for longer reports
- Fallback to browser print function if generation fails

### 2. **Truly Dynamic Responsive Design**

#### Fluid Typography
- Uses `clamp()` for all font sizes
- Example: `font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 4vw, 3rem)`
- Text scales smoothly between minimum and maximum sizes

#### Dynamic Spacing
- All padding/margins use viewport units with clamp()
- Example: `padding: clamp(1rem, 3vw, 2rem)`
- Spacing adapts to screen size naturally

#### Responsive Grid
- Uses `auto-fit` with `minmax()` for automatic column adjustment
- Example: `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(100%, 320px), 1fr))`
- Cards automatically reflow from 4 columns → 3 → 2 → 1

#### Container Queries
- Card content adapts based on card width, not viewport
- Better component-level responsiveness

### 3. **CSS Custom Properties**
- Centralized sizing system with CSS variables
- Easy to maintain and adjust
- Consistent scaling across all elements

### 4. **Improved Mobile Experience**
- Touch-optimized interactions
- Full-screen modal on mobile
- Smooth scrolling and animations
- Better iframe content adaptation
